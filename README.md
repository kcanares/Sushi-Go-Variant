# Sushi-Go-Variant

The following code contains functions for making strategical moves, and validating and calculating group scores for a variation of [Sushi Go!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go "Sushi Go! overview") 

The beauty of this variant is that it can be played without having to buy the official [Sushi Go! card pack](https://www.ebgames.com.au/product/toys-and-collectibles/256690-sushi-go-card-game "Sushi Go! EB games purchase"). Any regular pack of cards will do!

The mechanics of both games are the same, the only difference being the card scores. Numbered cards are scored based on its own value and royals are as follows: Jacks - 11, Queens - 12, Kings - 13. Aces are worth 20.
